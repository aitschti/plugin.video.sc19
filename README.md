# plugin.video.sc19

A kodi plugin for streaming cams from stripchat.com. Works with all kodi Matrix/Nexus releases (19 and 20)).

Tested on Android (Fire TV) and Windows, should work fine with other Linux systems. Not available in a kodi repository, so use "Install from ZIP" in kodi and point to the zip file to install.

## Features

- Listing of cams for all main categories
- Pagination for listings (set cams per page and type of listing in settings)
- Search for cam (exact name and fuzzy search)
- "Random 10" lists 10 random cams (feature from Stripchat API)
- Favourites list (with backup/restore function. Set path in settings first!)
- Check online state of favourite cams before listing them (with progress bar, takes some time, can be disabled in settings)
- View profile details of performer (context menu > videos and albums)
- Shows cam states of performer (idle, private etc.)
- When streaming a cam use info button for additional info about the room like topic, goal, viewers etc. (if available)

## Recommended settings

- Tested with Estuary skin only
- "Info wall" is the recommended view for listings as you get a little more details about the cam

## Todo

- multi language (english only for the moment)

Hope you enjoy!

(A version for chaturbate with similar features available in other repository)
