# plugin.video.sc19

A kodi plugin for streaming cams from stripchat.com. Works with all kodi releases 19, 20 and 21.

Tested on Android (Fire TV) and Windows, should work fine with other Linux systems. Not available in a kodi repository, so use "Install from ZIP" in kodi and point to the zip file to install.

## Features

- Listing of cams for all main categories
- Pagination for listings (set cams per page and type of listing in settings)
- Search for cam (exact name and normal fuzzy search)
- Favourites list (with backup/restore function. Set path in settings first!)
- Check online state of favourite cams before listing them (with progress bar, takes some time, can be disabled in settings)
- View profile details of performer (context menu > videos and albums)
- Shows cam states of performer (idle, private etc.)
- When streaming a cam use info button for additional info about the room like topic, goal, viewers etc. (if available)

## Recommended settings

- Tested with Estuary skin only
- "Info wall" is the recommended view for listings as you get a little more details about the cam

## Todo

- multi language (english only for the moment)

Hope you enjoy!

(A version for chaturbate with similar features available in other repository)
