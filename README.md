# plugin.video.sc19
A kodi plugin for streaming cams from stripchat.com. Works with all kodi Matrix releases (kodi version 19 upwards). 

Tested on Android (Fire TV) and Windows. Not available in a kodi repository, so use "Install from ZIP" in kodi and point to the zip file to install.

## Features
- Listing of cams for all main categories
- Pagination for listings (set cams per page and type of listing in settings)
- Search for cam (exact name and fuzzy search)
- "Random 10" lists 10 random cams (feature from Stripchat API)
- Favourites list (with backup function)
- View profile details of performer (context menu > video and albums)
- Shows cam states of performer (idle, private etc.)
- When streaming a cam use info button for additional info about the room like topic, goal, viewers etc. (if available)

## Recommended settings
- Tested with Estuary skin only
- "Info wall" is the recommended view for listings as you get a little more details about the cam

## Todo
- multi language (english only for the moment)

Hope you enjoy!

(A version for chaturbate with similar features to be released soon)
